# Source Install Organizer Script (please give name suggestions)

## Description:
 A shell script to log source installs. This tool works as a pseudo-package manager but instead of packages the script is entirely agnostic to tarballs (tar.gz and tar.xz tested). The current version only works on gnu make files but I plan to add more functionality. 

## Usage:
```
./installer.sh in <tarball>
./installer.sh del <program name>
```
